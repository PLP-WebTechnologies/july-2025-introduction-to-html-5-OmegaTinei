            <h2>Latest Blog Post: The Power of Semantic HTML</h2>
            <p><time datetime="2025-08-05">August 5, 2025</time> by Omega Usayi</p>
            <p>Semantic HTML5 elements are crucial for building accessible and search engine friendly websites. By using tags like `header`, `nav`, `main`, `section`, `article`, and `footer`, we provide meaning to our content beyond just presentation.</p>
            <p>This structural clarity helps assistive technologies interpret the page correctly for users with disabilities, and it also aids search engine crawlers in understanding the hierarchy and relevance of your content, leading to better search rankings.</p>
            <h3>Why Semantics Matter for SEO</h3>
            <p>Search engines prioritize well-structured content. When your HTML clearly defines what each part of your page represents, crawlers can more accurately index your content. This leads to improved visibility and relevance in search results.</p>
